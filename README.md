## Design Principles

This project was developed following:

* **DDD:** Structuring code around core domain logic.
* **TDD:** Writing tests before implementation to ensure correctness (check
  commits history [here](https://github.com/KarimGl/moneta/commits/main/)).
* **SOLID:** Ensuring maintainable, extensibility and decoupled design.

## Used Technologies

- Java **21**
- JUnit **5** (for testing)
- Maven 3+ (for build)
